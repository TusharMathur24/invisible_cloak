# invisible_cloak
This project is inspired by the famous Invisibility Cloak from Harry Potter, bringing a fun concept to life using Python and OpenCV. The program leverages computer vision techniques to make a person appear invisible by masking a specific color in real-time video feed and replacing it with a static background.
